* `Python 3`

## Limitations & Known issues
There is currently no route provided by the [ESI](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/) to reliably identify the NPC faction of a NPC corp, see [esi-issues #917](https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/issues/917) (feature request). However, EveBroker uses a workaround to at least identify the NPC factions of founding NPC corporations.
